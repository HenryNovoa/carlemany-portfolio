## <u>HTML CSS PORTFOLIO FOR UNIVERSITY ACTIVITY</u>

This activity was done as a first activity for Web aplications for Universitat Carlemany.

To be able to use and modify Sass the following procedure is recommended:

If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using npm by running

`npm install -g sass`

If you use the Chocolatey package manager for Windows, you can install Dart Sass by running

`choco install sass`

Install on Mac OS X or Linux (Homebrew)
If you use the Homebrew package manager for Mac OS X or Linux, you can install Dart Sass by running

`brew install sass/sass/sass`

I personally used the node installation as I remember when setting up Sass on my windows machine I had some problems using Chocolaty.

In this particular activity, I used the command:

`sass --watch portfolio.scss style.css`

to be able to edit and whenever I would save it would directly transribe to css.

Documentation regarding SCSS can be found here:

https://sass-lang.com/documentation/

The features that I have used is:

- Nesting
- Variables

I tried using BEM naming convention as I felt that it goes really good with SASS.

A pretty good explanation can be found here:
